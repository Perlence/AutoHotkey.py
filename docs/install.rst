Installation
============

AutoHotkey.py requires `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ 3.7 and
newer, `AutoHotkey <https://www.autohotkey.com/>`_ 1.1.28 and newer.

Once Python is installed, install the package to the Python user install
directory. To do that, copy and paste the following into a PowerShell window:

.. code-block:: text

   py -m pip install --user autohotkey.py

AutoHotkey.py is now installed. Check out the :doc:`/quickstart` or go to the
:doc:`Documentation Overview </index>`.
