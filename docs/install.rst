Installation
============

AutoHotkey.py requires `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ 3.8 or
later and `AutoHotkey <https://www.autohotkey.com/>`_ 1.1.28 or later.

Once you've installed Python, install the AutoHotkey.py package to the Python
user install directory. To do that, copy and paste the following into a
PowerShell window:

.. code-block:: text

   py -m pip install --user autohotkey.py

Now you've installed AutoHotkey.py. Next, you might want to check out
:doc:`/quickstart` or the :doc:`Documentation Overview </index>`.
